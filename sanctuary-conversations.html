		<section id="Introduction">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The US sanctuary movement is an Underground-Railroad-inspired campaign that began in churches in the 1980s to provide safety to immigrants at risk of deportation. In the decades since, hundreds of churches across the country have participated, providing shelter and protection as well as material goods and legal resources to their guests. I had the privilege of being involved in one such campaign while I lived in Boston, and I'm proud that we successfully helped a mother and her two young daughters avoid deportation and achieve legal status.</p>
			<p>Many organizations, including the <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://www.elca.org/news-and-events/8004">Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</a> and the <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://www.uunashua.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Sanctuary-FAQ.pdf">Unitarian Universalist Association</a>, have developed resources for congregations interested in providing sanctuary. However, few resources exist to help individual congregation members lead their communities toward participating in this mission. Before you can implement sanctuary, you must organize your community. Often, the most effective approach is not to go to your pastor first. Instead, you should borrow from the labor union playbook and engage every member of your community through one-on-one organizing conversations.</p>
			<p>What follows is a collection of 12 example organizing conversations with members of a congregation considering whether to provide sanctuary to Maria, a community member who fled persecution in Iran. In the real world, every immigrant's story is complicated and personal, and every sanctuary congregation is unique. My hope is that these conversations can serve as a practical template for anyone working to lead their congregation to put Matthew 25:35 into practice.</p>

		<section id="Carol">
			<h2>Compassionate Carol, Retired Teacher, 68</h2>
			<p class="intro">Deeply moved by the member's situation and wants to help, but worried about "doing it the right way." Concerns about whether sanctuary work conflicts with "respecting the law" as a Christian principle. Needs theological grounding about civil disobedience and biblical hospitality. Once convinced, becomes a passionate advocate.</p>
			<p class="setting">Carol's living room, late afternoon. She's served coffee and homemade cookies. Family photos and Lutheran devotional books are visible on the coffee table.</p>
			<div class="script">
				<p>Carol, thank you so much for having me over. I know you're always busy with your grandkids and volunteer work.</p>
				<p>Oh, it's no trouble at all. I'm always happy to talk about the church. Though I have to say, I've been thinking a lot about Maria's situation since Pastor mentioned it. It just breaks my heart.</p>
				<p>Tell me more about what you've been thinking.</p>
				<p>Well, as a teacher for thirty-five years, I worked with so many immigrant children. Beautiful families, hardworking parents who just wanted the best for their kids. But Maria... she's been part of our church family for what, two years now? She helps with the children's Christmas pageant. How can they just... take her away?</p>
				<p>It sounds like you really know Maria as a person, not just as someone with an immigration case.</p>
				<p>Exactly! That's what I keep thinking about. But then I wonder... I mean, I want to help, but I also believe we're supposed to follow the law. Romans 13 says we should obey governing authorities. I've been wrestling with this all week.</p>
				<p>That's such an important question, Carol. What do you think about when you read other parts of scripture - like when Jesus said to welcome the stranger, or when the midwives in Exodus disobeyed Pharaoh's orders to kill Hebrew babies?</p>
				<p>[pauses, considering] I... I hadn't thought about the midwives. They were protecting innocent lives, weren't they? And Pharaoh's law was wrong, even if it was the law.</p>
				<p>What parallels do you see there?</p>
				<p>Well, Maria isn't a criminal... [trails off] Maybe some laws aren't just, even if they're legal?</p>
				<p>You taught history - were there other times when Christians had to choose between human law and God's law?</p>
				<p>[getting more animated] Oh my goodness, yes! The Underground Railroad! Many of those conductors were Christians who believed they were following God's will, even though they were breaking the Fugitive Slave Act. I actually taught a whole unit on that.</p>
				<p>So when you think about those Christians who helped enslaved people escape, what do you think motivated them?</p>
				<p>They saw human beings created in God's image being treated as property. They couldn't just stand by and watch. [pause] Oh. I see what you're getting at.</p>
				<p>Tell me what you're thinking.</p>
				<p>Maria is God's child too. If our government is going to tear her away from us and send her back to a deadly situation... maybe our higher calling is to protect her, even if it means disobeying an unjust law.</p>
				<p>How would you feel about our church actually housing Maria on our property - giving her sanctuary in the most literal sense?</p>
				<p>[long pause] You mean... she would live at the church? Actually live there?</p>
				<p>That's what some sanctuary congregations do - they provide living space on church property where ICE has traditionally been reluctant to make arrests.</p>
				<p>[quietly] That's... that's a big step. I mean, I want to help her, but having someone actually living at church? What would that look like? Could ICE just come into our church? During worship?</p>
				<p>Legally, yes. They still need a judicial warrant to enter private spaces, and they can't just barge into offices or areas that aren't open to the public. But they could absolutely come onto church property, into the sanctuary during worship, into fellowship areas.</p>
				<p>[sitting back in her chair] That changes everything, doesn't it? I mean, when I was thinking about the Underground Railroad, those people could hide folks in their basements. But this... this would be like hiding someone in the town square.</p>
				<p>It does make it much more dangerous, and much more public. How does that feel to you?</p>
				<p>[long pause] Terrifying, honestly. I keep thinking about what would happen if ICE agents came during children's Sunday school. Those kids would be traumatized.</p>
				<p>Those are completely valid fears. What else worries you about this new reality?</p>
				<p>The congregation. I was worried before about people like Amy being scared, but now... now we're asking people to literally risk their safety every time they come to church. What if ICE thinks someone else in the congregation is undocumented? What if they arrest other people while they're looking for Maria?</p>
				<p>How do you think about balancing those risks against Maria's situation?</p>
				<p>[struggling] I... I don't know. We're asking every family that walks through those doors to risk becoming part of an immigration raid.</p>
				<p>What would help you think through this differently?</p>
				<p>I need to understand what happened with other churches. What happened to them? Were there actually raids? And I need to know - could we really protect Maria even if ICE came, or would we just be putting her and everyone else through trauma for nothing?</p>
				<p>Those are crucial questions. What else do you need to know?</p>
				<p>[more firmly] I need to know that this isn't just symbolic. If we're going to ask our congregation to take these risks, there has to be a real plan for how this helps Maria long-term. And I need to know that we've thought through every scenario - what happens during worship, during children's programs, during weddings and funerals.</p>
				<p>How are you feeling about the possibility now?</p>
				<p>[sighs deeply] Honestly? Part of me wants to say it's too dangerous, that we should find another way to help. But then I think about Maria. And I think about those Underground Railroad conductors - they knew they could be caught. They knew the penalties. But they did it anyway because it was right.</p>
				<p>What's the difference between their situation and ours?</p>
				<p>[thinking] Maybe... maybe there isn't one. Maybe the fact that it's more dangerous now doesn't change the moral calculation. Maybe it just means we have to be braver.</p>
				<p>What would "being braver" look like for you?</p>
				<p>It would mean accepting that every Sunday could be the Sunday ICE comes. It would mean having honest conversations with the congregation about what we're really asking of them. And it would mean committing to stand with Maria even when it's terrifying.</p>
				<p>How do you think the congregation would respond to that level of honesty?</p>
				<p>[ruefully] Some people would leave. Amy would probably take her kids and find another church. Rick might actually call ICE himself out of principle. But others... others might surprise us. Sometimes people are braver than we think when they understand what's really at stake.</p>
				<p>What would you need to feel ready to have those conversations?</p>
				<p>I'd need to talk to other congregations who are doing this under the new rules. I'd need to know our pastor is fully committed, knowing the risks. And I'd need to spend a lot of time in prayer, asking God if this is really what we're called to do.</p>
				<p>And what do you think about that last point - what you're called to do?</p>
				<p>[quietly] I think about Mary and Joseph at the inn. But now I also think about the innkeeper. Maybe he was scared too. Maybe he knew that harboring these strangers could bring trouble. But he opened his door anyway.</p>
				<p>What would opening our door look like now?</p>
				<p>[taking a deep breath] It would look like telling ICE - and telling our whole community - that we believe Maria belongs here, that she's family, and that we're not going to let her be taken without a fight. Even if that fight happens in front of everyone we love.</p>
				<p>How does that feel?</p>
				<p>[voice shaking slightly] Like the scariest thing I've ever considered. And also like maybe the most important thing our church has ever been asked to do.</p>
				<p>What questions do you still have?</p>
				<p>Can we really protect her if ICE comes with warrants? What's our legal situation - could individual church members be arrested for harboring? And honestly... what happens to our other ministries if we become known as "that church that hides immigrants"?</p>
				<p>Those are all critical questions we'd need to research thoroughly, but thankfully, I know someone who helped lead a sanctuary and could help us answer those questions. If we could get good answers to those concerns, how would you feel about moving forward?</p>
				<p>[long pause] I think... I think I'd be terrified and ready at the same time. This isn't the quiet, safe sanctuary I was imagining. But maybe quiet and safe isn't what Maria needs. Maybe she needs people willing to stand in the light with her, even when it's dangerous.</p>
				<p>What role would you want to play in that?</p>
				<p>I'd want to help prepare the congregation for what we're really asking of them. No sugar-coating, no false promises about safety. And if ICE comes... I'd want to be standing right next to Maria. I'd want them to have to go through me to get to her.</p>
				<p>Carol, that's incredibly brave.</p>
				<p>[smiling shakily] Or incredibly foolish. I guess we'll find out which. But I keep coming back to this: if not us, who? And if not now, when? Maria can't wait for ICE policies to change or for the political climate to improve. She needs sanctuary now, dangerous or not.</p>
				<p>Before I go, what would your next steps be?</p>
				<p>I need to pray about this more. I need to talk to other sanctuary churches. And I think... I think I need to have a very honest conversation with my own family about what I might be asking them to risk.</p>
				<p>Would you be willing to join a small group to start planning how we might move forward?</p>
				<p>[firmly] Yes. Yes, I would. But let's make sure everyone in that group understands exactly what we're talking about. No illusions about safety or easy answers. If we're going to do this, we're going to do it with our eyes wide open.</p>

		<section id="Larry">
			<h2>Lawyer Larry, Corporate Attorney, 52</h2>
			<p class="intro">Immediately focuses on legal liability for the church and individual members. Worries about property seizure, tax-exempt status, and personal legal exposure. Has misconceptions about what sanctuary actually entails legally. Needs accurate legal information and may become crucial for developing protocols once his concerns are addressed.</p>
			<p class="setting">Larry's home office on a Saturday morning. You've asked to meet privately to discuss "an important pastoral matter affecting our congregation."</p>
			<div class="script">
				<p>Larry, thanks for making time. I wanted to talk with you about Maria - you know her, she's been coming to church for about two years, sits with us usually.</p>
				<p>Sure, I know Maria. Nice woman. What's going on?</p>
				<p>She received a deportation order. ICE is actively looking for her. We're wondering if the church might provide sanctuary - letting her live on church property while we work with immigration attorneys and advocacy groups.</p>
				<p>[long pause] Oh boy. That's... that's a big ask. I mean, I feel for Maria, I really do, but do you understand the legal implications of what you're talking about?</p>
				<p>I have some understanding, but honestly, that's why I wanted to talk with you first. Help me think through this properly.</p>
				<p>Look, harboring someone with a deportation order - that's potentially a federal crime. We could be looking at criminal charges for church leadership, maybe even individual members. And that's just the criminal side. Civil liability, our insurance coverage, property seizure under asset forfeiture laws...</p>
				<p>What does "harboring" actually mean legally? Are we talking about just letting her stay in the fellowship hall, or does it require something more active?</p>
				<p>[leaning forward] The statute says "concealing, harboring, or shielding from detection." But here's the thing - there's this religious exception that some courts have recognized, and sanctuary churches have historically relied on it. The problem is, it's never been definitively tested at the Supreme Court level.</p>
				<p>So there's some legal precedent for churches?</p>
				<p>Sort of. But here's what really concerns me - Trump just eliminated the sensitive locations policy. You know what that was?</p>
				<p>I've heard of it, but tell me what it means practically.</p>
				<p>It was an internal ICE policy that said they'd avoid enforcement actions at churches except in extraordinary circumstances. It wasn't law, but it was real protection because ICE didn't want the bad PR of raiding churches. Now that's gone. They could literally walk into Sunday service and arrest Maria.</p>
				<p>How likely do you think that is?</p>
				<p>[pause] I don't know. That's what scares me. We'd be betting the entire congregation's wellbeing on ICE deciding not to act. What happens to our 200 other members - including families with kids - if ICE shows up during worship? What's that trauma do to our community?</p>
				<p>Those are real concerns. What would you need to feel more comfortable with the risks?</p>
				<p>Honestly? I'd want to talk to immigration attorneys who specialize in sanctuary cases. I'd want our insurance company to weigh in on coverage. I'd want protocols for what happens if ICE shows up. And I'd want the congregation to vote on this with full understanding of what we're risking.</p>
				<p>That all makes sense. What if we could get those things in place?</p>
				<p>[long pause] Look, I like Maria. She's part of our community. But I took an oath as an attorney to uphold the law. I'm struggling with actively helping someone avoid legal deportation proceedings.</p>
				<p>Can you help me understand that tension? Because I'm wrestling with it too.</p>
				<p>I believe in due process. If Maria has a legal case, she should pursue it through proper channels. If she doesn't... [trails off] I guess I'm asking, are we helping her or are we helping her avoid consequences?</p>
				<p>Maria's been trying to adjust her status for three years. When she first arrived in the US, she spoke to the FBI without an attorney present. Her previous attorney, working pro bono, botched her case, and by the time she got a new lawyer, her options were limited. She's not avoiding the system - the system failed her.</p>
				<p>[pause] I didn't know that. That... that changes things somewhat.</p>
				<p>What would you need to hear to help you think through this differently?</p>
				<p>I'd want to understand her case better. If she's got legitimate legal options being pursued, that's different than just hiding from deportation. And I'd want guarantees that we're not just enabling someone to avoid consequences, but actually buying time for legitimate legal processes.</p>
				<p>Would you be comfortable hearing Maria's story directly from her? I know Maria has had to tell her story many times, which is exhausting. I've written up the key points so you can understand the situation. After you've read it, would you want to have a brief conversation with her, or would you prefer to process this information first and then we can talk about next steps?</p>
				<p>[considering] Yes, I think that would be helpful. I'd like to understand her perspective.</p>
				<p>And what about the legal questions you raised - the liability issues, insurance, protocols? How do we get good information about that?</p>
				<p>We'd need to talk to attorneys who've actually advised churches doing sanctuary work. Not Maria's immigration lawyer - attorneys who understand institutional risk for religious organizations.</p>
				<p>Would you be willing to help identify those resources?</p>
				<p>[pause] Yeah, I could probably find some contacts. And honestly, if we're going to do this, you need someone who understands the legal risks helping with protocols and procedures.</p>
				<p>Does that mean you'd consider supporting this if your concerns were addressed?</p>
				<p>[pause] I'm not saying no. But I need to understand what we're really getting into. And the congregation needs to make this decision with full knowledge of the risks. No sugar-coating.</p>
				<p>Fair enough. So next steps - I'll send you Maria's story for you to read. And then maybe we can talk about what legal consultation we need after that?</p>
				<p>Yeah. Let's start there.</p>

		<section id="Amy">
			<h2>Anxious Amy, Suburban Mom, 41</h2>
			<p class="intro">Sympathetic but terrified about safety for her children and the "unknowns" of having undocumented people in the church. Influenced by media portrayals of immigration. Fears neighborhood property values declining or community backlash. Needs personal stories to humanize the issue and reassurance about safety measures.</p>
			<p class="setting">Amy's kitchen table, mid-morning after she's dropped her kids at school. You've already mentioned sanctuary to her after church, and now you're meeting to discuss details.</p>
			<div class="script">
				<p>Thanks for making time to talk, Amy. I know you're busy with everything you have going on.</p>
				<p>Of course. I've been thinking about Maria a lot since you mentioned what's happening with her deportation case. It's just... I don't know, this feels so big and scary.</p>
				<p>Have you had a chance to get to know Maria much over the past couple years?</p>
				<p>A little. She's always so quiet, but really sweet. She helped in the nursery a few times when we were short-staffed. The kids liked her. She's... she's not what I picture when I think about immigration stuff, you know?</p>
				<p>What do you mean by that?</p>
				<p>I don't know, I guess I had this image of people crossing the border illegally, but she came here legally and then something happened with her asylum case. She speaks perfect English. She has a college degree. She's been working and paying taxes.</p>
				<p>Yeah, Maria came here fleeing persecution in Iran. Her asylum case got caught up in the legal system, and now she's facing deportation back to a country where she could face real danger for her faith.</p>
				<p>That's what I don't understand though. Why can't she just... fix her legal status? Get the right papers?</p>
				<p>I thought the same thing initially. But I learned that once you're in deportation proceedings, there's no line to get in. The system is set up so that if your asylum case gets denied, your options become very limited, even if you have strong community ties and have been contributing here for years.</p>
				<p>So if she gets deported back to Iran...</p>
				<p>She could face imprisonment or worse because of her Christian faith. That's why she originally fled.</p>
				<p>[Long pause] Oh God. I hadn't really thought about what would actually happen to her. I just kept thinking about the legal problems for us.</p>
				<p>What would it mean for you if something happened to Maria after we could have helped but didn't?</p>
				<p>[Tears up] I can't even think about that. But I also can't stop thinking about what happens to my family if ICE shows up at church. What if they think we're all criminals? What if it's on the news and people at school give my kids a hard time?</p>
				<p>Those are really valid concerns, Amy. Can I ask - do you remember when your family first started coming to our church?</p>
				<p>Yeah, about five years ago when we moved here. I was so anxious about finding community, making sure the kids felt welcome.</p>
				<p>And how did people welcome you?</p>
				<p>Everyone was so kind. Pastor introduced us around, people invited us to events, the Sunday school teachers learned my kids' names right away. It felt like we belonged.</p>
				<p>That's what we're talking about doing for Maria. She's already part of our church family, and now she needs us to show her that belonging isn't conditional on her legal status.</p>
				<p>But the risks are so different now. You said yourself that Trump got rid of the protections for churches.</p>
				<p>You're right, the risks are real. But I keep thinking about what kind of church we want to be. Do we only protect people when it's convenient and safe?</p>
				<p>No, but... [pauses] What would this actually look like? Would she be living in the church building? Would people know?</p>
				<p>We're still figuring out the details, but probably she'd stay in the church building, and we'd need people to help with meals, companionship, advocacy. The goal would be to buy time while her lawyers work on her case.</p>
				<p>How long could that take?</p>
				<p>We don't know. Could be weeks, could be months. Maybe longer.</p>
				<p>Do you really think ICE might come to the church?</p>
				<p>I think it's possible in a way it wasn't before. But Amy, if we don't do this, ICE will definitely deport Maria - just not at our church. At least this way, she has a chance, and we're standing with her.</p>
				<p>[Long pause] I need to talk to Mike about this. And I need to think about how to talk to the kids about it if we decide to support this.</p>
				<p>Of course. What would help you feel more comfortable with making this decision?</p>
				<p>I guess I need to understand better what the safety plan would be. Like, if something did happen during church, how would we protect the kids? And I think I need to talk to Maria myself. I've been thinking about this whole thing, but I haven't really thought about her as a person.</p>
				<p>That makes a lot of sense. What if I put together a brief written summary of Maria's story - just the basics about her background and situation? That way you can learn more about her without putting her in the position of having to retell difficult experiences over and over.</p>
				<p>That would be really helpful. I feel like I need to understand her situation better, but you're right - I wouldn't want to make her go through explaining everything again just for my benefit.</p>
				<p>Exactly. I can get you something to read that explains her background and why she's facing deportation.</p>
				<p>That would be perfect. And maybe... is there some other way I could get to know her better as a person? Like, could I help with something she needs without making it about her immigration case?</p>
				<p>That's a really thoughtful way to think about it. Maybe you could come visit her and chat some Saturday.</p>
				<p>Yeah, that feels better. I want to understand her situation, but I also want to see her as Maria, not just as 'the person we're trying to help.'</p>
				<p>I'll get you that written summary by tomorrow, and we can talk about other ways to connect that don't put the burden on her to educate everyone about her case.</p>

		<section id="Tom">
			<h2>Theological Tom, Semi-Retired Pastor/Professor, 65</h2>
			<p class="intro">Supports the concept biblically but gets lost in abstract theological debates about Romans 13 and authority. May intellectualize rather than act. Needs to connect theology to concrete action and could become a valuable resource for educating others once engaged.</p>
			<p class="setting">Tom's home office, coffee mugs on the desk, after you've spent 15 minutes catching up on family and church life.</p>
			<div class="script">
				<p>Tom, I wanted to talk with you about something that's been weighing on my heart. You know Maria - she's been coming to church for about two years now?</p>
				<p>Of course, lovely young woman. Very thoughtful in Bible study. She's from Iran, right?</p>
				<p>Yes. Tom, she's facing deportation, and she's terrified. She came here seeking asylum from persecution back home, but her case has been denied.</p>
				<p>Oh my goodness. That's... that's heartbreaking. What happens if she goes back?</p>
				<p>As a Christian convert from Islam in Iran? She could face imprisonment, or worse. Tom, some of us have been talking about whether our church should offer her sanctuary - let her stay on church property while we work on other legal options.</p>
				<p>[long pause] Well, that's... that's a profound question. I mean, biblically speaking, the concept of sanctuary has deep roots. Cities of refuge in Numbers, the hospitality commands... but then there's Romans 13 about governing authorities...</p>
				<p>I've been wrestling with Romans 13 too. What do you think Paul meant when he wrote that?</p>
				<p>[settling into professor mode] Well, the context matters enormously. Paul was writing to a specific community about not unnecessarily antagonizing Roman authorities. But we also have to consider the Hebrew midwives in Exodus who disobeyed Pharaoh's orders, or Daniel refusing to stop praying...</p>
				<p>So when do we obey earthly authorities and when don't we?</p>
				<p>[thoughtful] I think the Lutheran tradition gives us some guidance here. Bonhoeffer certainly didn't believe Romans 13 meant passive compliance with unjust laws. And our own ELCA social statements talk about civil disobedience in cases of moral necessity...</p>
				<p>What would constitute moral necessity for you?</p>
				<p>[long pause] Well, if someone's life is genuinely at risk... I mean, we're talking about Maria potentially facing persecution for her faith. That's not abstract theology - that's a sister in Christ whose life could be in danger.</p>
				<p>I keep thinking about Matthew 25 - "I was a stranger and you welcomed me."</p>
				<p>[nodding slowly] Yes, and the Greek word there - <i>xenos</i> - it's not just stranger, it's foreigner, outsider. Someone without legal status or protection... trails off</p>
				<p>Tom, I can see you working through this theologically. What concerns do you have?</p>
				<p>[sighs] Well, practically speaking, what does this actually look like? I mean, we're not talking about hiding someone in a basement...there's real risk that ICE could come right onto church property.</p>
				<p>You're right - the risks are real. But what if that's exactly when the church needs to take a stand?</p>
				<p>[leaning forward] You know, I've been thinking about the Confessing Church in Germany. When the state demanded compliance with unjust laws, the church had to decide what it meant to be church. Sometimes faithfulness requires risk.</p>
				<p>What would help you think through whether this is one of those times?</p>
				<p>[thoughtful] I'd want to understand the legal situation better - both for Maria and for us. And I'd want to think through what pastoral care looks like if we're housing someone who's facing this kind of trauma and uncertainty.</p>
				<p>Those are important questions. Would you be willing to meet with some others to explore this further? Maybe we could bring in someone who has experience with sanctuary, and think together about what faithful response looks like?</p>
				<p>[nodding] Yes, I think that would be valuable. And you know, I keep coming back to something Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrote - "We are not to simply bandage the wounds of victims beneath the wheels of injustice, we are to drive a spoke into the wheel itself."</p>
				<p>What do you think that means for us and Maria?</p>
				<p>[pause] Maybe it means we don't just pray for her and send her back to face persecution. Maybe driving a spoke into the wheel means saying "not on our watch" - even if it costs us something.</p>
				<p>Tom, would you be willing to help others in the congregation work through these theological questions? A lot of people respect your scholarship and might have similar concerns about Romans 13 and civil disobedience.</p>
				<p>[straightening up] You know, I think I would. This is exactly the kind of situation where theology needs to meet real life. And if we're going to do this, we need to do it thoughtfully, with biblical grounding and pastoral wisdom.</p>
				<p>Thank you, Tom. Can I follow up with you in a few days about next steps?</p>
				<p>Absolutely. And... pray for Maria. And for all of us as we discern what faithfulness looks like in this moment.</p>

		<section id="Pam">
			<h2>Practical Pam, Small Business Owner, 55</h2>
			<p class="intro">Asks "but what does this actually look like day-to-day?" Worries about logistics, costs, and sustainability. Concerned about the church taking on more than it can handle. Needs clear, realistic plans and may become excellent at implementation once her practical concerns are addressed.</p>
			<p class="setting">Coffee shop near the church, Tuesday afternoon</p>
			<div class="script">
				<p>Thanks for meeting with me, Pam. I know you're busy with the shop.</p>
				<p>Of course. You sounded pretty serious. What's going on?</p>
				<p>Well, I wanted to talk with you about Maria - you know her, right? She's been coming to church for about two years now.</p>
				<p>Sure, Maria. Sweet girl. She helps with the coffee setup sometimes. Why?</p>
				<p>She's facing deportation, and she's terrified. She came here from Iran, and if she's sent back... well, it's not safe for her there, especially as a woman who's become Christian.</p>
				<p>Oh my God. That's terrible. But what can we do? I mean, there have to be legal options, right?</p>
				<p>That's what I thought too. But her lawyer says she'll likely be deported before they've exhausted the appeals. The immigration system is really complex, and sometimes people fall through the cracks even when they've done everything right.</p>
				<p>[pauses] Okay, so what are you thinking?</p>
				<p>Some of us are wondering if the church should offer her sanctuary - let her stay on church property while we figure out next steps. But I wanted to talk with people individually first, because this is a big decision that affects everyone.</p>
				<p>[sits back] Sanctuary. Like, she'd live at the church?</p>
				<p>That's the idea. We'd need to set up a space for her - maybe convert one of the Sunday school rooms or use the pastor's study. It would be temporary while we work on other solutions.</p>
				<p>[long pause] I mean, my heart goes out to her, it really does. But... okay, help me understand the logistics here. Where would she sleep? What about showering? Cooking? And for how long are we talking?</p>
				<p>Those are exactly the right questions. Honestly, we're still figuring out the details. That's why I wanted to talk with you - you're always good at thinking through the practical stuff.</p>
				<p>[warming up slightly] Well, the fellowship hall has that little kitchen. And there's the bathroom by the office. But living in a church building... that's not really set up for residential use. What about building codes? Are we allowed to have someone living there?</p>
				<p>We'd need to check on that. Probably need to be discreet about it too.</p>
				<p>And what happens if ICE shows up?</p>
				<p>It's definitely a risk. That's part of why this feels so urgent.</p>
				<p>[shaking her head] So we could have federal agents showing up during Sunday service? With kids there?</p>
				<p>It's possible. I won't lie to you about that.</p>
				<p>[long pause] And how long could this go on? I mean, what's the exit strategy here?</p>
				<p>That's the hard part. It could be weeks, could be months. We'd be working with lawyers and advocacy groups to find other solutions, but there's no guarantee.</p>
				<p>[sighs] Look, I like Maria. She's a good person. But I'm trying to run a business, and I've got the church board responsibilities, and now you're asking me to commit to something that could go on indefinitely with federal agents potentially involved?</p>
				<p>I hear you. It's a lot. What would you need to feel okay about this?</p>
				<p>I'd need to know exactly what we're signing up for. Like, a real plan. Who's going to be there with her? What are the schedules? What supplies does she need? How much is this going to cost? Who's paying for food, utilities, whatever modifications we need to make?</p>
				<p>Those are all fair questions.</p>
				<p>And I'd need to know what happens if this affects the church's other operations. We've got the preschool, the AA meetings, the food pantry. What if having Maria there puts any of that at risk?</p>
				<p>What would help you think through those concerns?</p>
				<p>Well, we'd need to talk to our insurance company, for starters. And probably a lawyer who knows about this stuff. And we'd need a real budget - not just "we'll figure it out as we go."</p>
				<p>That makes sense. If we could get those answers, how would you feel about it then?</p>
				<p>[pauses] I don't know. Part of me thinks this is what churches should do - help people. But another part of me worries we're in over our heads. What if we start this and then can't sustain it? And what about the congregation? Are we all on board with this? Because if we're divided, that's not going to help anyone.</p>
				<p>That's actually why I'm having these conversations. To see where people are and what concerns they have.</p>
				<p>[nods] Smart. Because this could really split the church if it's not handled right.</p>
				<p>What would it take to handle it right, do you think?</p>
				<p>Transparency. Real planning. And honestly? We'd probably need to start smaller. Maybe there's a way to help Maria that doesn't require her living at the church full-time.</p>
				<p>What are you thinking?</p>
				<p>I don't know. Financial support for a lawyer? Connecting her with other resources? Maybe sanctuary is the right answer, but shouldn't it be the last resort?</p>
				<p>That's worth exploring. Would you be willing to be part of a small group that looks at all the options?</p>
				<p>[considers] Yeah, I could do that. But I want to be clear - I'm not committing to sanctuary right now. I'm committing to helping figure out what's realistic and what's not.</p>
				<p>Fair enough. And Pam? Thanks for being honest about your concerns. This is exactly the kind of thinking we need.</p>
				<p>Well, if we're going to do this, we need to do it right. Maria deserves better than good intentions and chaos.</p>

			<p class="intro">Rarely speaks up but has deep personal convictions. May have had positive experiences with immigrant coworkers or neighbors. Concerned about speaking out publicly but willing to help behind the scenes. Needs encouragement that there are many ways to contribute.</p>
			<p class="setting">After worship service, organizer approaches Quinn as she's quietly gathering her things.</p>
			<div class="script">
				<p>Hey Quinn, do you have a few minutes to chat? I wanted to talk with you about something important.</p>
				<p>[looks up, slightly surprised] Oh, sure. What's going on?</p>
				<p>Well, I don't know if you've gotten to know Maria very well - she's been coming to church for about two years now? The woman from Iran who usually sits with us?</p>
				<p>[nods] Yes, I know who you mean. She seems really sweet. Always very quiet, like me I guess. small smile</p>
				<p>She is sweet. And she's in a really scary situation right now. ICE has been trying to deport her back to Iran, and... well, you probably know what's happening to Christians there right now, especially those who've been living in the West.</p>
				<p>[face grows concerned] Oh no. That's... that's really dangerous for her, isn't it?</p>
				<p>It is. She could face imprisonment, or worse. So some of us have been talking about whether our church might be able to offer her sanctuary - let her stay on church property while we work on legal options and advocacy.</p>
				<p>[quiet for a moment, processing] That's... that's a big step. I mean, I want to help her, but... trails off</p>
				<p>What are you thinking? I'd really like to hear your perspective.</p>
				<p>[fidgets with her purse] Well, I keep thinking about how scared she must be. I can't even imagine. And she's been part of our community - she's not just some stranger. But then I think, couldn't ICE just... come here during service?</p>
				<p>That's a really valid concern. The risk is definitely higher now. That's actually why I wanted to talk with you specifically - I've noticed how thoughtful you are about things, and I value your judgment.</p>
				<p>[looks surprised] You do?</p>
				<p>Absolutely. You really listen to people, and you think things through carefully. What's your sense of how Maria's doing with all this stress?</p>
				<p>[pauses] Actually, I have noticed she seems more anxious. Last time I saw her, she was sitting alone after service looking really overwhelmed, and I almost went over to her but... shakes head I should have said something.</p>
				<p>It sounds like you really care about her wellbeing.</p>
				<p>I do. I know what it's like to feel alone in a group of people, even good people. And the thought of her being sent back to face... shudders I can't stop thinking about those women protesting there and what happens to them.</p>
				<p>So if we did decide to offer sanctuary, what would worry you most?</p>
				<p>[thinks carefully] Honestly? I worry about what happens to her if ICE does come. Does it make things worse for her legally? And I worry about... well, what if there's violence? What if someone gets hurt trying to protect her?</p>
				<p>Those are really important questions. The legal piece is complicated - sometimes deportation happens anyway, but at least there's more time to work on appeals and advocacy. As for safety, that's something we'd need to plan for very carefully.</p>
				<p>[nods slowly] And I guess... I mean, I'm not someone who's comfortable being in the spotlight or making speeches or anything like that. But I keep thinking about Jesus and the woman at the well, and how he didn't turn away from people that society wanted to cast out.</p>
				<p>That's a beautiful way to think about it. And you know, there are so many ways to help that don't involve being in the spotlight. Things like helping with meals or just being someone Maria can talk to - someone who understands what it's like to be quiet in a noisy world.</p>
				<p>[small smile] I could do that. I mean, if we decided to do this, I could definitely help in ways that... that fit who I am.</p>
				<p>That would mean so much. Can I ask - what would you need to feel comfortable with the church taking this step?</p>
				<p>[pauses] I guess I'd want to know that we really thought it through. That we're not just reacting emotionally, but that we have plans for different scenarios. And I'd want to know that Maria actually wants this - that we're not just deciding what's best for her without asking her.</p>
				<p>Those are exactly the right questions. Would you be willing to be part of some conversations about planning this out? You don't have to commit to anything, but your input would be really valuable.</p>
				<p>[nods slowly] Yes, I think I would. And... could I maybe talk with Maria sometime? I mean, if she's comfortable with that? I just think she should know that people care about her as a person, not just as a cause.</p>
				<p>I think she would really appreciate that, Quinn. Thank you for being so thoughtful about this.</p>
				<p>[gathering her things] This is scary, but... it feels like the right kind of scary, you know?</p>

May have misconceptions about immigrants being "criminals" or "not following proper procedures." Needs patient dialogue about systemic issues and may surprise you with eventual support.</p>
			<p class="setting">Rick's living room, Saturday afternoon. You've asked to stop by to talk about Maria's situation.</p>
			<div class="script">
				<p>Thanks for letting me come by, Rick. I know you're busy with your yard work. I wanted to talk with you about Maria's situation - I know you've gotten to know her some over the past couple years.</p>
				<p>[settles into his chair] Yeah, she's a nice enough girl. Shame about her situation. But look, I'm gonna be straight with you - I don't understand why she didn't just do things the right way from the beginning.</p>
				<p>What do you mean by the right way?</p>
				<p>Well, apply for asylum properly, go through the legal channels. I mean, we're a nation of laws, right? My grandfather came here from Germany, went through Ellis Island, did everything by the book.</p>
				<p>That makes sense that you'd want people to follow the process. Can I ask - do you know much about how the asylum process works now, especially for someone from Iran?</p>
				<p>[shrugs] I assume you apply, they review your case, and if it's legitimate, you get to stay. If not, you go back and try again through proper channels.</p>
				<p>I didn't know much about it either until recently. Turns out it's pretty different from when our ancestors came through Ellis Island. For someone from Iran, especially a woman, you have to already be in the United States to apply for asylum. There's no way to apply from Iran. And then you have one year from when you arrive to file your claim, but if you don't speak English well or don't have a lawyer...</p>
				<p>[interrupting] Well, there are lawyers who help with this stuff, right?</p>
				<p>There are, but there's no right to appointed counsel in immigration court like there is in criminal court. And the average wait time for an asylum hearing is about three to four years. Maria's been waiting two and a half years for her hearing.</p>
				<p>[pauses, looking thoughtful] So she did file properly?</p>
				<p>She did. She's been doing everything by the book, showing up to all her check-ins with ICE, following all the rules. The problem is, the US deports people back to Iran even while their asylum cases are still pending.</p>
				<p>[frowning] But if she's got a legitimate claim...</p>
				<p>That's just it - she won't get to make her case if they deport her before the hearing. And Rick, I don't know if you know much about what's happening to people who get sent back to Iran right now, especially Christians who've been living in the West...</p>
				<p>[long pause] Look, I served two tours. I know what those regimes are capable of. But... [rubs his face] This is a hell of a situation you're putting the church in. You're asking us to harbor someone who ICE wants to deport. That's not civil disobedience, that's obstruction.</p>
				<p>I hear you. This isn't an easy decision. Can I ask you something though? In your military service, did you ever have to make a choice between following orders and doing what you knew was right?</p>
				<p>[gets quiet] That's... that's different.</p>
				<p>How so?</p>
				<p>[long pause] Because those were life and death situations. Combat decisions. This is... [trails off]</p>
				<p>What do you think happens to Maria if she gets sent back to Iran?</p>
				<p>[very quietly] Probably nothing good. [looks up] But what happens to our church if ICE comes here? What happens to Pastor? What happens to the other members?</p>
				<p>Those are fair questions. I'm scared too. But I keep thinking about something you said in Bible study last month - about how your unit never left anyone behind. Even when it was dangerous. Even when it would have been easier.</p>
				<p>[rubs his eyes] Don't use my service against me.</p>
				<p>I'm not trying to. I'm asking you to help me think through what it means to not leave Maria behind. I'm not saying you have to agree with sanctuary. But I value your judgment, Rick. If we were going to do this, how would we do it right? How would we minimize risk? How would we prepare?</p>
				<p>[long silence] You're really asking me to help you plan to break federal law.</p>
				<p>I'm asking you to help me think through how to protect someone who's part of our church family. Someone who's been following the law but is about to be sent back to a place where she could be imprisoned or killed for being a Christian convert.</p>
				<p>[another long pause] She converted here?</p>
				<p>About a year after she started coming. You were there for her baptism.</p>
				<p>[very quietly] Shit. looks up If they send her back to Iran as a Christian convert...</p>
				<p>Yeah.</p>
				<p>[stands up, paces] This is... God damn it. sits back down I need to think about this. I need to pray about it. But if... if the congregation decides to do this, you're going to need someone who understands security. Someone who knows how to plan for worst-case scenarios.</p>
				<p>Are you saying...?</p>
				<p>I'm saying I can't let you all stumble into this unprepared. If we're going to do this, we're going to do it right. But I need some time to wrap my head around it. She's a good kid. pause This is going to tear the church apart, you know that?</p>
				<p>Maybe. Or maybe it'll show us what we're really made of.</p>
				<p>[stands up] Give me a week. I want to understand her situation better - can you put together something that explains her story? What she's fleeing, how she ended up here, what she's been through with the legal process?</p>
				<p>I can do that. I'll write up what I know and what she's comfortable sharing.</p>
				<p>Good. And start thinking about operational security. If we do this, we can't have people posting about it on Facebook or gossiping about it at the grocery store. People's lives depend on doing this right.</p>
				<p>Thank you, Rick. For listening. For considering it.</p>
				<p>[walking you to the door] Don't thank me yet. I haven't decided anything. But... [pauses] I didn't serve overseas so we could send people back to places where they'll be tortured for their faith. I need to figure out how to square that with everything else I believe.</p>

			<h2>Privileged Patricia, Country Club Member, 63</h2>
			<p class="intro">Well-meaning but disconnected from immigration realities. Thinks the solution is just "becoming legal" and doesn't understand systemic barriers. Worried about what her social circle will think. Needs education about immigration law complexity and may be motivated by status concerns about the church's reputation.</p>
			<p class="setting">Patricia's living room, over coffee</p>
			<div class="script">
				<p>Thanks for having me over, Patricia. I know you're busy with the country club fundraiser coming up.</p>
				<p>Of course! I always have time for church business. How can I help?</p>
				<p>Well, I wanted to talk with you about Maria - you know, she sits with us?</p>
				<p>Oh yes! She's lovely. Very quiet, but she has such a sweet smile. I've been meaning to introduce myself properly.</p>
				<p>I'm glad you've noticed her. She's been part of our congregation for about two years now, and she's become really important to many of us. I actually wanted to talk to you about something serious she's facing.</p>
				<p>Oh dear, is she alright?</p>
				<p>Well, we've been told ICE wants to send her back to Iran and will likely deport her soon.</p>
				<p>Oh my goodness! But... I mean, can't she just... isn't there paperwork she can file? My friend's housekeeper had some immigration issues a few years back, and her lawyer sorted it all out.</p>
				<p>That's what I thought too, initially. But Maria's situation is more complicated. She's seeking asylum because she could face persecution in Iran - she's a Christian convert, and that can be dangerous there. But her asylum case was denied.</p>
				<p>But surely there must be something... I mean, if she's really in danger...</p>
				<p>The immigration system is much more limited than most of us realize. Even when someone has a genuine fear of persecution, the legal pathways are incredibly narrow. Maria has done everything by the book, but sometimes the system fails people.</p>
				<p>That's just... that doesn't seem right. She's such a faithful person. I see her in Bible study sometimes.</p>
				<p>Exactly. And that's why I wanted to talk with you. Some of us are exploring whether our church might offer Maria sanctuary - essentially, letting her stay on church property while we work with lawyers and advocates to find other solutions.</p>
				<p>[long pause] On church property? You mean... living at the church?</p>
				<p>Yes. It's not something we'd do lightly, but it's a way to prevent her deportation to a situation where she could face real danger for her faith.</p>
				<p>I... wow. I've never heard of such a thing. Is that even legal?</p>
				<p>It's complicated. Churches aren't legally immune from immigration enforcement, but there's a long tradition of religious institutions providing sanctuary to people in need. We'd be very careful about how we do it.</p>
				<p>But what would people think? I mean, our church has such a good reputation in the community. The Hendersons from the club just started attending after I invited them. What if this makes us look like... like we're breaking the law?</p>
				<p>I understand that concern. Can I ask you something though? When you think about what our church stands for - what we believe about welcoming the stranger, about loving our neighbor - how do you think we should respond to Maria's situation?</p>
				<p>[Fidgets with her coffee cup] Well, of course we should help her. It's just... this seems so dramatic. Couldn't we just help her find a good lawyer? I'd be happy to contribute to a legal fund.</p>
				<p>We've already done that. She's had excellent legal representation, but she's run out of legal options. Patricia, I keep thinking about that passage we read a few weeks ago - "I was a stranger and you welcomed me." Maria isn't a stranger anymore, is she? She's part of our church family.</p>
				<p>[Quietly] No, she's not a stranger. I just... I worry about what this means for our church. We've worked so hard to build our reputation, to attract new members. The capital campaign is going so well...</p>
				<p>I hear you. Those things matter too. But I wonder - what kind of reputation do we want? Do we want to be known as the church that's successful and respectable, or as the church that stands up for what's right even when it's difficult?</p>
				<p>[Long pause] Can I ask you something? What would this actually look like? I mean, day to day?</p>
				<p>We're still figuring that out. But probably Maria would have a private space in the church building. She'd continue participating in church life, maybe help with some ministries. We'd need people to coordinate meals, provide emotional support, help with practical needs.</p>
				<p>And you think ICE might actually come to our church?</p>
				<p>It's possible, but Patricia, think about Maria sitting in that pew every Sunday. She's already risking everything just by being here, just by living her faith. Maybe it's time we risked something too.</p>
				<p>[Touches her cross necklace] I need to think about this. And pray about it.</p>
				<p>Of course. And Patricia, whatever you decide, I want you to know that your voice matters in this conversation. You're respected in this congregation, and people listen to you.</p>
				<p>[Smiles slightly] Well, I do have some influence on the board. And at the country club, honestly. Maybe... maybe that's not such a bad thing in this case.</p>
				<p>What do you mean?</p>
				<p>Well, if we're going to do this, we need the community to understand why. And I do know how to talk to people like me - people who might be skeptical at first. Maybe that's how I can help.</p>
				<p>That would be incredible, Patricia. I have a written account of Maria's story - her journey from Iran, why she had to leave, how she found our church, what she's facing now. Would you like me to share that with you? It really helps put a human face on what we're talking about.</p>
				<p>Yes, I'd like to read that. Sometimes it's hard to understand what people are really going through without knowing the details.</p>
				<p>I'll email it to you tonight. And Patricia, if after reading it you have questions or want to know more about any part of her experience, we can talk about the best way to get those answers. Maria has been very generous in sharing her story, but I want to be mindful of not overwhelming her with requests.</p>
				<p>That makes sense. She's probably already dealing with so much stress.</p>

			<h2>Young Professional Yolanda, Marketing Manager, 29</h2>
			<p class="intro">Socially progressive and supportive in theory but overwhelmed by work and social commitments. Concerned about time requirements and may prefer writing checks to hands-on involvement. Needs flexible, concrete ways to contribute that fit her lifestyle.</p>
			<p class="setting">Coffee shop near the church, Sunday afternoon after service</p>
			<div class="script">
				<p>Thanks for meeting with me, Yolanda. I know Sundays are probably one of your few free days.</p>
				<p>Of course! Though I have to admit I'm curious what this is about. You seemed pretty serious when you asked to talk.</p>
				<p>I wanted to talk with you about Maria - you know her, right? She's been coming to church for about two years now.</p>
				<p>Oh yeah, Maria! She's really sweet. I remember she helped with the welcome table a few times. She's from Iran, right?</p>
				<p>That's right. Yolanda, Maria is facing deportation. ICE is trying to remove her, and her legal options are running out.</p>
				<p>Oh no, that's terrible. I had no idea. Is there anything we can do to help her legally?</p>
				<p>Her lawyer is still working on some appeals, but it's not looking good. That's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. Some of us are exploring whether our church might offer Maria sanctuary - letting her stay on church property while we continue advocating for her case.</p>
				<p>Wait, like actually live at the church? Is that... legal?</p>
				<p>It's complicated. Churches have done this before, but there are real risks. ICE could potentially come onto church property.</p>
				<p>Wow, that's... that's a big deal. I mean, I feel awful for Maria, but living at the church? How would that even work?</p>
				<p>That's part of what we're trying to figure out. Before we make any decisions, I'm talking with different people in the congregation to hear their thoughts. What's your initial reaction?</p>
				<p>Honestly? I'm overwhelmed just thinking about it. I mean, Maria seems like a really good person, and I can't imagine being in her situation. But this sounds like it would be huge for the church. And if ICE could actually show up...</p>
				<p>What specifically feels overwhelming about it?</p>
				<p>Well, I'm barely keeping up with work as it is. I feel guilty that I don't volunteer more at church already. And this sounds like it would need a lot of people involved - like, someone would need to be there with her, right? She'd need food, support, probably legal help...</p>
				<p>You're right that it would require a community effort. Can I ask - do you know much about Maria's situation? How she ended up here?</p>
				<p>Not really. I know she's from Iran, but we've never really talked about why she came here or anything.</p>
				<p>Maria came here because she was facing persecution in Iran. She was involved as an activist, and the government was cracking down. She applied for asylum, but the system is so backlogged and complicated that her case has been stuck for years.</p>
				<p>Oh wow. I had no idea. That's... I mean, I can't imagine living with that uncertainty.</p>
				<p>Right. And now she's facing deportation back to a country where she could face imprisonment or worse. That's why some of us are wondering if the church might be called to step in.</p>
				<p>When you put it that way... I mean, as Christians, isn't that exactly what we're supposed to do? But I have to be honest - I'm worried about what this would mean for the church. Would we become a target? Would it affect our other ministries?</p>
				<p>Those are really valid concerns. What specifically worries you about becoming a target?</p>
				<p>I guess I'm thinking about safety, but also... this feels so political. I know some people in the congregation have different views on immigration. Would this tear the church apart?</p>
				<p>That's something we're thinking about carefully. That's why I'm having these conversations - to understand where people are and what concerns they have. What do you think it would take for you to feel comfortable with something like this?</p>
				<p>I'd need to know more about the practicalities, honestly. Like, what would be expected of me? I want to help, but I can't commit to being there every day or anything. And I'd want to know that we're not just doing this impulsively - that there's a real plan.</p>
				<p>That makes total sense. If this moves forward, there would need to be lots of different ways to contribute - some people might help with meals, others with logistics. Not everyone needs to do everything.</p>
				<p>And what about the legal risks? I mean, I work in corporate marketing - I can't afford to get arrested or anything that would affect my job.</p>
				<p>I understand that concern. We'd want to make sure everyone knows exactly what they're signing up for. Can I ask - have you had a chance to really get to know Maria at all?</p>
				<p>Not really, beyond just saying hi at church. I feel bad about that now.</p>
				<p>That makes total sense. Rather than asking Maria to tell her story over and over, let me share some of what she's comfortable having people know, and I can also give you a written summary that she's approved. Would that be helpful for you to have?</p>
				<p>Yes, definitely. It's hard to think about this in the abstract when I don't really know her situation.</p>
				<p>I'll get that to you this week.</p>

		<section id="Steve">
			<h2>Skeptical Steve, Engineer, 58</h2>
			<p class="intro">Questions whether this is the church's role or if it should be left to "proper channels." Worries about political polarization within the congregation. May have concerns about "enabling" rather than helping. Needs discussion about the church's prophetic role and practical outcomes.</p>
			<p class="setting">Steve's kitchen table, Saturday morning coffee. The organizer already mentioned sanctuary briefly after church.</p>
			<div class="script">
				<p>Thanks for making time to chat, Steve. I know you're always busy with your projects.</p>
				<p>No problem. Though I have to say, I'm not sure what there is to discuss. This whole sanctuary thing seems like it's gotten out of hand.</p>
				<p>What do you mean by "out of hand"?</p>
				<p>Well, look - I feel bad for Maria, I really do. She seems like a nice person. But the church getting involved in immigration law? That's not what we're supposed to be doing. We have social services, we have legal aid organizations, we have proper channels for this stuff.</p>
				<p>Tell me more about what you see as the church's role.</p>
				<p>We're supposed to worship God, support each other, maybe do some charity work. But deliberately harboring someone who's here illegally? That's not ministry, that's politics. And it's going to tear the congregation apart.</p>
				<p>You mentioned Maria seems like a nice person. What's your sense of her?</p>
				<p>[pauses] She's... she's been coming to Bible study pretty regularly. Asks thoughtful questions. She helped with the kitchen renovation last year - did good work, actually. Very precise. [longer pause] But that's not the point.</p>
				<p>What is the point, from your perspective?</p>
				<p>The point is we're a church, not a political organization. Half the congregation is already uncomfortable with this whole discussion. And now we're talking about ICE potentially showing up during Sunday service. You want to traumatize kids and elderly people to make a political statement?</p>
				<p>That's a real concern. What would it look like if ICE did show up?</p>
				<p>Exactly! It would be chaos. People would be terrified. And for what? Maria gets deported anyway, and we've destroyed the peace of our church community in the process.</p>
				<p>Steve, help me understand something. You mentioned Maria's been coming to Bible study. What's she shared about her situation?</p>
				<p>[shifts uncomfortably] Well, she's talked about... about being afraid. About having to be careful where she goes.</p>
				<p>What else?</p>
				<p>[long pause] She said she hasn't been able to go home to Iran since she got here. She misses her family. [voice softens slightly] That was... that was hard to hear.</p>
				<p>I can imagine. How do you think she feels knowing ICE could pick her up any day now?</p>
				<p>[defensive again] Look, I'm not heartless. But she knew the risks when she came here. And there have to be legal ways to handle this. Immigration lawyers, appeals, something.</p>
				<p>You're right that those systems exist. Maria's been trying to navigate them for years. Her asylum case was denied, her appeals are held up in the backlog. Her lawyer says she's running out of time despite doing everything by the book.</p>
				<p>So what's the end game here? She lives in the church basement forever?</p>
				<p>That's a fair question. This would be about buying time - time for potential policy changes and time for her legal team to find other options. It's not permanent, but it's a lifeline.</p>
				<p>[skeptical] And you really think the congregation can handle ICE showing up? What about liability? What if someone gets hurt?</p>
				<p>Those are legitimate concerns. If we move forward, we'd need clear protocols, legal consultation, crisis planning. Nothing would happen without thinking through all the scenarios.</p>
				<p>[long pause] I just... I don't see how this ends well for anyone. The church gets divided, Maria might get deported anyway, and we've made ourselves a target.</p>
				<p>Steve, let me ask you something different. When you think about Maria specifically - not the politics, not the policy questions - but Maria sitting in Bible study asking questions about faith, what do you think she needs from her church community right now?</p>
				<p>[very long pause, voice quieter] She needs... she needs to know she's not alone. That people care about what happens to her.</p>
				<p>And what do you think it would mean to her to know that her church family is willing to take risks for her?</p>
				<p>[stares at coffee mug] I... I don't know. I mean, I get it. But I still think there have to be better ways.</p>
				<p>You might be right. But what if there aren't? What if this is the choice - act now with the church community, or watch Maria disappear one day?</p>
				<p>[frustrated] This is exactly what I was worried about. Now it's all emotional manipulation. "If you don't support sanctuary, you don't care about Maria."</p>
				<p>That's not what I'm saying. I'm asking what you think faithful response looks like when someone in our community is in danger.</p>
				<p>[long silence] I need to think about this. This whole thing is just... it's not what I signed up for when I joined this church.</p>
				<p>I understand. These aren't easy questions. Can we talk again next week?</p>
				<p>[sighs] Yeah. Yeah, we can talk. But I'm not promising anything.</p>

		<section id="Claudia">
			<h2>Committed Claudia, Social Worker, 44</h2>
			<p class="intro">Already convinced and ready to act immediately. May become impatient with the organizing process and want to skip ahead. Valuable ally but needs to understand the importance of bringing others along gradually for long-term success.</p>
			<p class="setting">Coffee shop near the church, Tuesday afternoon</p>
			<div class="script">
				<p>Thanks for meeting with me, Claudia. I know you're swamped with work, but I really wanted to talk with you about Maria's situation.</p>
				<p>Of course. I've been thinking about her nonstop. When she shared during prayer time that ICE had contacted her... I mean, she's been part of our community for two years. This is just wrong.</p>
				<p>I feel the same way. That's actually why I wanted to talk. A few of us have been discussing whether our church should offer Maria sanctuary - literally let her live on church property while we figure out longer-term solutions.</p>
				<p>[leans forward] Yes. Absolutely. When do we start? I can help her move in this weekend if needed.</p>
				<p>I appreciate your heart, Claudia, I really do. But I'm curious - what does that look like to you? Like, practically speaking?</p>
				<p>Well, she could stay in the fellowship hall, or maybe we could set up something more private in the Sunday school wing. I could bring her meals, help coordinate volunteers...</p>
				<p>Those are good thoughts. What about the fact that Trump just eliminated the sensitive locations policy? ICE could literally raid the church now without violating any of their own guidelines.</p>
				<p>[pauses] I... honestly, I hadn't thought about that part. But that just makes it more urgent, doesn't it? We can't let fear paralyze us.</p>
				<p>You're right that we can't let fear paralyze us. But I'm also thinking about Maria. If ICE shows up during Sunday service and arrests her in front of the whole congregation - including kids - what does that do to her? What does it do to our church community?</p>
				<p>[sits back] Okay, I see what you're getting at. It's not just about our willingness to help. It's about whether we're actually helping or potentially making things worse.</p>
				<p>Exactly. And here's the thing - for this to work, it can't just be you and me and maybe two other people. We need broad support from the congregation. Because if ICE does come, we need everyone to understand why we made this choice and be prepared for what that means.</p>
				<p>Right. Because if half the congregation freaks out or gets angry, that creates its own problems. [pauses] How many people have you talked to about this?</p>
				<p>You're actually one of the first. I wanted to start with people I knew would be supportive, but also people who could help me think through the challenges.</p>
				<p>So what's the plan? Are we talking to everyone individually first?</p>
				<p>That's what I'm thinking. One-on-one conversations with church members to really understand where people are, what their concerns are, what they'd need to feel comfortable supporting this.</p>
				<p>[nods slowly] That makes sense. And honestly, as much as I want to help Maria right now, she deserves to know that if we're going to do this, we're doing it right. Not just rushing in because we feel bad.</p>
				<p>What do you think Maria needs to know about our process?</p>
				<p>That we're serious about this, but we're also being strategic. That we're not going to put her in a more vulnerable position just to make ourselves feel better. pauses And that regardless of what we decide about sanctuary, we're committed to supporting her through this.</p>
				<p>That's really important. What would you want to know if you were in her position?</p>
				<p>Honestly? I'd want to know the real risks. Not just the hopeful version where everything works out, but the actual worst-case scenarios. And I'd want to know that the people making this decision had really thought it through.</p>
				<p>How do you think we should approach some of the members who might be more hesitant?</p>
				<p>[laughs] You mean like practically everyone except us? I think... look, I know I get impatient with process stuff. But people like Tom are going to need to work through all the theological implications. And people like Carol are going to need to feel like this is consistent with their faith, not in conflict with it.</p>
				<p>What about the legal concerns people are going to have?</p>
				<p>We need real information, not just wishful thinking. Maybe Larry could help with that, even if he's not initially supportive? And honestly, we probably need to talk to Maria's lawyer too, to understand how sanctuary fits into her overall legal strategy.</p>
				<p>That's a good point. What role do you see yourself playing in these conversations?</p>
				<p>I want to help, but I also know I can come across as... intense. Maybe I'm better at the practical stuff - figuring out logistics, coordinating volunteers - rather than the initial convincing conversations.</p>
				<p>I think you're underestimating yourself. What would you need to feel confident that we're ready to make this commitment?</p>
				<p>Honestly? I'd need to know that at least two-thirds of the active congregation is genuinely supportive, not just going along with it. And I'd need to know we have a real plan for if ICE shows up - not just for Maria, but for how we handle it with the community, the media, the kids who might be there.</p>
				<p>Those are really good benchmarks. Are you willing to help with some of these individual conversations?</p>
				<p>Absolutely. Maria deserves that from us.</p>

		<section id="Frank">
			<h2>Fearful Frank, Retiree, 71</h2>
			<p class="intro">Remembers when the neighborhood was "different" and has general anxiety about change. Worried about the church becoming a "target" and what that might mean for Sunday worship feeling safe and familiar. Needs reassurance about maintaining church community while expanding ministry.</p>
			<p class="setting">Frank's living room, coffee on the table, mid-afternoon visit</p>
			<div class="script">
				<p>Thanks for letting me come by, Frank. I know you've been part of the congregation for what, fifteen years now?</p>
				<p>Sixteen, actually. Been through a lot of changes here. [shifts uncomfortably] I know you wanted to talk about... this situation with Maria.</p>
				<p>Yeah, I did. I'm curious - what's your sense of Maria? You've seen her around for a couple years now.</p>
				<p>She seems like a nice enough girl. Quiet. Always says hello. I know she helps with the coffee cleanup sometimes. [pauses] But I have to be honest with you - I'm really worried about what you're proposing.</p>
				<p>Tell me about that worry, Frank.</p>
				<p>Look, I've been going to this church longer than most people. It's been my sanctuary, you know? [voice gets a bit shaky] After Martha died, this place... it's where I feel safe. Where I can pray and not worry about the outside world coming in. And now you're talking about bringing all this... this danger right into our sanctuary.</p>
				<p>That sounds really important to you - having the church feel like a safe place.</p>
				<p>It is. And I'm not heartless - I feel for Maria, I really do. But what happens to the rest of us? What happens to our church? I keep thinking about those images on the news - agents in gear, people being dragged away. What if that happens during Sunday service? What if some kid sees that?</p>
				<p>Those are real concerns, Frank. Can I ask - what do you think would happen to Maria if she can't stay here?</p>
				<p>[long pause] I... I don't really know. She'd have to go back to Iran, I suppose.</p>
				<p>Have you ever talked with Maria about what her life was like there?</p>
				<p>No, not really. She doesn't talk much about it.</p>
				<p>I understand that. It's actually really difficult for her to talk about. Maria was involved in the protests there. She was arrested. Frank, they told her if she was arrested again, it wouldn't just be prison.</p>
				<p>[quietly] Oh.</p>
				<p>So when you ask what happens to her if she can't stay here... we're not just talking about her having to move. We're talking about her possibly facing torture or death.</p>
				<p>[very quietly] I didn't know that.</p>
				<p>Most people don't. And Frank, I get why you're scared. You've found peace in this place after losing Martha. That's sacred. But I keep thinking about something - what made this church feel like sanctuary to you when you needed it most?</p>
				<p>[thinking] It was... people cared about me. When I was falling apart, people just... they were there. They didn't ask questions, they just showed up.</p>
				<p>Right. And that's what Maria has found here too, isn't it? A place where people care, where people show up.</p>
				<p>[nods slowly] Yeah, I guess so.</p>
				<p>Frank, I can't promise you this won't change things. I can't promise there's no risk. But I can tell you that if ICE comes, it won't be because Maria is a dangerous person. It'll be because our government is willing to send agents into churches to arrest someone whose only crime was believing people should have basic rights.</p>
				<p>[long pause] What would it actually look like? Day to day, I mean.</p>
				<p>Well, Maria would probably stay in the Sunday school building. She's pretty self-sufficient. The biggest change would be that some of us would need to coordinate bringing her groceries, staying with her sometimes so she's not alone. She'd probably join us for worship when she feels comfortable.</p>
				<p>Would people know? I mean, would everyone know she's there?</p>
				<p>We'd need to be careful about how we talk about it, but honestly, Frank, this is about being transparent with our community, not hiding things.</p>
				<p>[sighs heavily] I just... I'm old, you know? I don't understand all this immigration stuff. I don't know what's legal and what's not. I just want to go to church and feel like God is there.</p>
				<p>Frank, can I ask you something? When you're in worship, and we read about Jesus saying "I was a stranger and you welcomed me" - what does that mean to you?</p>
				<p>[long pause] I always thought it meant being nice to visitors on Sunday morning.</p>
				<p>Maybe it does. But maybe it also means this. Maybe God is asking us to trust that the Holy Spirit can still be present in our sanctuary, even when - especially when - we're taking risks to protect someone who needs protection.</p>
				<p>[quiet for a long moment] What if something goes wrong? What if they do come and arrest her? What if it's chaos and people get hurt?</p>
				<p>Those are real possibilities, Frank. If we do this, we need to be prepared for that. But I keep thinking - what if we don't do this, and Maria gets deported, and something happens to her? How do we live with that?</p>
				<p>[rubs his face] I don't know. I just don't know.</p>
				<p>You don't have to know right now. But Frank, would it help if I shared a bit more about Maria's story with you? I have her permission to talk about her situation with people who are considering how our church should respond.</p>
				<p>[hesitates] I... maybe. If she's okay with that.</p>
				<p>She is. I wrote up some of her background - not everything, but enough to help people understand what she's facing. Would you like to read through this when you have some quiet time?</p>
				<p>[takes the paper carefully] Yeah, I think that would help.</p>
				<p>Take your time with it. And Frank, if you have questions after reading it, you can always call me. You don't need to process this alone.</p>
				<p>[nods slowly] Okay. I'll read it. And I'll think about it.</p>
				<p>That's all I can ask. Thanks for being honest with me about your concerns. They're important, and they're going to help us think through how to do this right, if we do it at all.</p>
