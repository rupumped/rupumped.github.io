# rupumped.github.io
My personal website. To visit, go to https://rupumped.github.io/. This ReadMe is just so I can brag about its technical merits. I coded it from scratch without even using bootstrap, and I'm proud of it.

## Completely free of JavaScript
JavaScript is a useful tool for many applications, but slows down browsers and has a history of security vulnerabilities. My personal website has interactive and responsive elements, but it does so using CSS. The only exception is for the display of mathematical formulas, for which I use [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).

## W3C Compliant
I used Celian Riboulet's [W3C Web Validator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CelianRiboulet.webvalidator) to ensure users should have the same experience regardless of their preferred browser.

## Mobile-Friendly
Google's [Mobile-Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly) certifies my personal website as mobile-friendly. Flexboxes and CSS `@media` at-rules ensure all content adapts to smaller screens.

## Optimized for Search Engines
If not for the British film actor who shares my name, this website would be the first result returned by Google given a search for "Nicholas Selby." The pages' HTML headers are complete, the parent directory includes a `robots.txt` file, and my content has been checked and approved by an array of PageRank-style SEO tools.

## Accessible
I used the [Firefox Accessibility Inspector](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/accessibility_inspector/index.html) to ensure that each page of my personal website is accessible and easily parsable by screen readers. All images have `alt` attributes, all links are descriptive and/or have ARIA labels, dark mode can be set through the browser, and every page adheres to the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) international standard.

## Open Source
