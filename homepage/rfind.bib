	abstract = {State-of-the-art RFID localization systems fall under two categories. The first category
	operates with off-the-shelf narrowband RFID tags but makes restrictive assumptions
	on the environment or the tag's movement patterns. The second category does not make
	such restrictive assumptions; however, it requires designing new ultra-wideband hardware
	for RFIDs and uses the large bandwidth to directly compute a tag's 3D location. Hence,
	while the first category is restrictive, the second one requires replacing the billions
	of RFIDs already produced and deployed annually. This paper presents RFind, a new
	technology that brings the benefits of ultra-wideband localization to the billions
	of RFIDs in today's world. RFind does not require changing today's passive narrowband
	RFID tags. Instead, it leverages their underlying physical properties to emulate a
	very large bandwidth and uses it for localization. Our empirical results demonstrate
	that RFind can emulate over 220MHz of bandwidth on tags designed with a communication
	bandwidth of only tens to hundreds of kHz, while remaining compliant with FCC regulations.
	This, combined with a new super-resolution algorithm over this bandwidth, enables
	RFind to perform 3D localization with sub-centimeter accuracy in each of the x/y/z
	dimensions, without making any restrictive assumptions on the tag's motion or the
	environment.},
