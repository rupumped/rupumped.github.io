	abstract = {Quantitative evaluation of the microstructural state of a specimen can be deduced from knowledge of the sample’s absolute acoustic nonlinearity parameter, β, making the measurement of β a powerful tool in the NDE toolbox. However, the various methods used in the past to measure β each suffer from significant limitations. Piezoelectric contact transducers are sensitive to nonlinear signals, cheap, and simple to use, but they are hindered by the variability of the interfacial contact between transducer and specimen surface. Laser interferometry provides non-contact detection, but requires carefully prepared specimens or complicated optics to maximize sensitivity to the higher harmonic components of a received waveform. Additionally, laser interferometry is expensive and relatively difficult to use in the field. Air-coupled piezoelectric transducers offer the strengths of both of these technologies and the weaknesses of neither, but are notoriously difficult to calibrate for use in nonlinear measurements. This work proposes a hybrid modeling and experimental approach to air-coupled transducer calibration and the use of this calibration in a model-based optimization to determine the absolute β parameter of the material under investigation. This approach is applied to aluminum and fused silica, which are both well-documented materials and provide a strong reference for comparison of experimental and modeling results.}
