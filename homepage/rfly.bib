	abstract = {Battery-free sensors, such as RFIDs, are annually attached to billions of items including
	pharmaceutical drugs, clothes, and manufacturing parts. The fundamental challenge
	with battery-free sensors is that they are only reliable at short distances of tens
	of centimeters to few meters. As a result, today's systems for communicating with
	and localizing battery-free sensors are crippled by the limited range.To overcome
	this challenge, this paper presents RFly, a system that leverages drones as relays
	for battery-free networks. RFly delivers two key innovations. It introduces the first
	full-duplex relay for battery-free networks. The relay can seamlessly integrate with
	a deployed RFID infrastructure, and it preserves phase and timing characteristics
	of the forwarded packets. RFly also develops the first RF-localization algorithm that
	can operate through a mobile relay.We built a hardware prototype of RFly's relay into
	a custom PCB circuit and mounted it on a Parrot Bebop drone. Our experimental evaluation
	demonstrates that RFly enables communication with commercial RFIDs at over 50 m. Moreover,
	its through-relay localization algorithm has a median accuracy of 19 centimeters.
	These results demonstrate that RFly provides powerful primitives for communication
	and localization in battery-free networks.},
