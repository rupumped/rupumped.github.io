        <p>Renewable energy credits (RECs) are a way to track and verify the production of renewable energy, such as solar, wind, or hydro power. When renewable energy is generated, a corresponding renewable energy credit is also created. These credits can then be bought and sold to offset non-renewable energy consumption.</p>
        
        <p>Renewvia RECs, or "R-RECs," take this concept a step further by using blockchain technology to ensure that the credits are tracked and verified in a secure and transparent way. By using a blockchain platform, R-RECs can provide a more reliable and efficient way of tracking renewable energy production and consumption, making it easier for businesses and individuals to invest in renewable energy and reduce their carbon footprint.</p>
            
        <p>By using blockchain technology, R-RECs provide a more secure and transparent way of tracking renewable energy production and consumption than traditional renewable energy credits. Every R-REC transaction is uniquely identified on the blockchain, so it can't be manipulated. This creates a reliable and efficient way of tracking renewable energy, making it easier for businesses and individuals to invest in sustainable energy sources and reduce their carbon footprint.</p>
            
        <p>Trading R-RECs can also provide a new source of revenue for renewable energy producers. By selling their R-RECs on a marketplace, they can generate additional income while incentivizing the adoption of sustainable energy practices.</p>

        <p>Renewvia mints one R-REC for every megawatt-hour of electricity produced by our PV panels. When businesses partner with us to fulfill their energy needs using Renewvia solar installations, they can receive the R-RECs generated by their installation as a complimentary value-add. Additionally, Renewvia can sell the R-RECs generated by our mini-grid projects to fund sustainable rural electrification.</p>

        <p>Currently, more than 10,000 R-RECs are being traded by companies around the world, creating a growing market for renewable energy credits. By participating in this marketplace, Renewvia is helping to drive the adoption of sustainable energy practices while also generating additional revenue streams to support our mission. We believe that R-RECs offer a unique and innovative solution for tracking and verifying renewable energy production, and we are proud to be at the forefront of this emerging market.</p>
            
        <p>The software behind R-RECs is completely open source on <a aria-label="GitHub repository" rel="external" href="https://github.com/Renewvia-Energy/Renewvia-REC" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
